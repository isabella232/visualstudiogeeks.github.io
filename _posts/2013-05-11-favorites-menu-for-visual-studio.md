Favorites Menu for Visual Studio, is a **FREE** add-in for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and 2008. This add-in will help in marking your frequently used files as your favorites within Visual Studio IDE and then you can access these any time and inside Visual Studio Environment.   

### What does Favorites Menu for Visual Studio do? ###

This add-in will install a new menu called `Favorites` inside your Visual Studio IDE. You will also see a new solution explorer like dockable `My Favorites` window. The add-in allows you to add any file to make it as your favorite file. This is very much similar to Internet Explorer\'s Favorites or the Firefox's bookmarks feature. You can access these files anytime, just by opening My Favorites window. The add-in also has a tagging feature and hence you can tag your file when marking them as your favorite. Tagging a file allows you to categorize your favorites and also helps you while searching for favorites. Within My Favorites window you can search favorites using the tags. Apart from these you have option of editing/adding tags any time you want. You can also remove files from your favorites.

> Note: Please uninstall previous version of this add-in from your system before installing Favorites Menu for Visual Studio.
