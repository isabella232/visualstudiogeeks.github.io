As a consultant I have had the joy of working with various customers and partners who in my opinion absolutely misunderstood DevOps! Read on to find out the DevOps anti-patterns and some DevOps quotes to go with it...

# DevOps Anti-pattern 1: The DevOps Team! 
Creating a new team and calling them DevOps does not let you break the silo between the Development team and the Operations team...

# DevOps Anti-pattern 2: Build it & They'll Come...

# DevOps Anti-pattern 3: The DevOps Tool chain...  
DevOps is all about tools! The tool obsessed get into a fight on why tool 1 is better than tool 2 and why they just can't get started unless they have tool 3.

Hilarious as it may sound, these bright people want to PoC every tool set and want to standardize the tools for all teams possible. Unfortunately, with tools, one size doesn't fit all!
