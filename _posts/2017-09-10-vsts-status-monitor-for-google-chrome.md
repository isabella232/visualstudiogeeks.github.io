Interested in getting notified when Microsoft [Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)](https://visualstudio.com/vsts) goes down for maintenance or when it comes back up? Well, now you can, using this simple Google Chrome extension.

## Install ##

Already interested to install? Wow, this feels great! Click this link below.

Still undecided? read on...

## Does it add an icon to Chrome toolbar? ##


![VSTSStatusMonitor-Up]({{site.url}}/images/screenshots/utkarsh/Sep17/up-toolbar.png)

Yes, it does..and you can monitor the status straight from the toolbar via the extension icon. The icon has a green dot when VSTS is up and red dot when VSTS is down.

Click on the icon, and you will see that the extension pops up a window displaying the current status of the VSTS along with any message which VSTS team has posted about the status. You also see when the next check for VSTS is made. 

> Currently, this extension checks the status every 5 minutes.


## Notifications ##

Who do not love notifications? I love them too and this extension supports notifications. It shows the notification when anything interesting happens with VSTS. Isn't it cool? :)

## Options ##

Are notifications not for you? - Ah, I remember  - my wife hates them too! That's why I made notifications optional. Uncheck both the checkboxes in the Options and extension won't bug you again! Happy?
