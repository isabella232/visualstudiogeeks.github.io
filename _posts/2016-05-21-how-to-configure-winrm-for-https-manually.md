In this post we will see how you can configure [WinRM (Windows Remote Management)][1] service to work with HTTPS manually.

Configuring for HTTPS involves following steps.

- Check whether WinRM service is running
- Create HTTPS listener
- Add firewall exception
- Validate HTTPS listener
- Verify you can connect to the machine via HTTPS

For the demo purposes I have built a new VM using AzureDevTestLab. We will perform the above steps in this VM and enable it for HTTPS communication. 

### Check whether WinRM service is running ###
WinRM is installed by default in all supported Windows machines. Ensure that service is in `running` state in `services`.

### Create HTTPS listener ###

By default when you run `winrm quickconfig` command WinRM is only configured for HTTP (port 5985). You can check already registered listeners by running following command.

```console
WinRM e winrm/config/listener
``` 

You will see output like below.

To enable HTTPS for WinRM, you need to open port 5986 and add HTTPS listener in the VM. 

Before we start doing that, we will first need to create a self-signed certificate and get its thumbprint. To create a self signed certificate we can use either `makecert` command or a `New-SelfSignedCertificate` powershell commandlet. I am using powershell commandlet here. Open your powershell window in `Adminstrator` mode and run the below command.

```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "<YOUR_DNS_NAME>" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My
```

This command will create a new self signed certificate and output the  certificate thumbprint.

DNS name used in the above command is your machine hostname and for Aure portal VM's you can get it from the portal from VM properties.

Copy the thumbprint to clipboard and run the following command. This command will register the HTTPS listener in WinRM

```powershell
winrm create winrm/config/Listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS @{Hostname="<YOUR_DNS_NAME>"; CertificateThumbprint="<COPIED_CERTIFICATE_THUMBPRINT>"}
```
You will see output as below.

### Add firewall exception ###

#### **Via Firewall applet from Control Panel** ####
- Open `Windows Firewall` from Control Panel
- Go to `Inbound Rules` then click `New Rule`
- This will open the wizard

![WinRM Firewall Wizard]({{site.url}}/images/screenshots/utkarsh/2016-05-21_winrm_firwall_wizard.png)

- Select Port and then TCP
- Enter port as `5986`

![WinRM Firewall Port]({{site.url}}/images/screenshots/utkarsh/2016-05-21_winrm_firwall_port_add_wiz.png) 

- In the next screens select `Allow the connection`
- In the profile page check all the checkboxes.
- Finally give a name to the rule.

#### **Via command** ####

You can also do the same operation and add firwall exception for port `5986` by running the following command in powershell console as `Administrator`.

```powershell
# Add a new firewall rule
port=5986
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Windows Remote Management (HTTPS-In)" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=$port
```

### Validate HTTPS listener ###

You can verify listener you added by running the same command you used above - `WinRM e winrm/config/listener`. This will show the new HTTP listener now along with previous HTTPS listener.

### Verify you can connect to the machine via HTTPS ###

We have done with your WinRM configuration and now we need to verify we can connect to this VM using HTTPS.

Run the following commands in powershell window as `Administrator`

```powershell
$hostName="<DNS_NAME>" # example: "mywindowsvm.westus.cloudapp.azure.com"
$winrmPort = "5986"

# Get the credentials of the machine
$cred = Get-Credential

# Connect to the machine
$soptions = New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName $hostName -Port $winrmPort -Credential $cred -SessionOption $soptions -UseSSL
```
On entering the last command, you will be logged in to remote machine's powershell session. As you can see in the screenshot below, you are connected and you can get the items from the remote virtual machine.
