When doing the upgrade of TFS2015 from previous update version you might get an error as `TF254027 : Cannot create a binding on port 443 because the specified certificate could not be found`. In this post we will see detailed steps to solve it.

## Cause ##

The error is caused if the certificate you used to configure HTTPS for TFS 2015 is not found.

## Solution ##

Click `Previous` button in the wizard till you go to `Application Tier` tab.

Click `Edit Site Settings` to open the below dialog

![Edit Site Binding]({{site.url}}/images/screenshots/utkarsh/tf254027-cert-not-found/website-settings.jpg)

Select `https` protocol (port 443) and click `Edit`. This will open a dialog below.

If you have your organization certificate, you should see it in the `SSL Certificate` dropdown. If you see the correct certificate, select it to use it - and you can skip rest of the blog post :-)

If you do not have any certificate (or certificate has been removed accidentally), you can create a self signed certificate using IIS. 

### Create a self signed certificate ###

To create self signed certificate you can follow the steps mentioned [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/tip-trick-enabling-ssl-on-iis7-using-self-signed-certificates). 

### Assign the certificate ###

Once you create the self signed certificate, come back to the wizard and you should see the certificate.

Re-run the readiness check and you should see all checks pass.
