Announcement - Book on implementing ALM and DevOps using Team Foundation Server 2015  
<!--more-->

> I am delighted to announce that my first book on Team Foundation Server 2015 has now shipped!

I have been working with Team Foundation Server for over a decade, helping customers unlock the true potential of the product. I am a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in Visual Studio and Development Tools for over 5 years now, working closely with Microsoft Product Teams to help shape the product to be most relevant to the users. I have worked with a broad range of customers in financial, trading, telecommunications and social sectors. While customers have varying levels of maturity in software application lifecycle management there is however a broad overlap in the problem areas hindring their ability to achieve continuous delivery of high quality software. 

> I have used my experience and learnings from these engagements to author over 80 hands-on DevOps and ALM focused labs for Scrum Teams to enable software teams to champion the implementation of modern application lifecycle and DevOps tooling using Team Foundation Server 2015. 

This book is a recipe-based guide that uses a problem-solution format to call out inefficiencies in the software development lifecycle and then guides you, step-by-step, on how you can use Team Foundation Server to your advantage in those areas. This book is aimed at software professionals including Developers, Testers, Architects, Configuration Analysts, and Release Managers who want to understand the capabilities of TFS to deliver better quality software faster. 

## Team Foundation Server 2015 Cookbook 

The book has 340 pages divided into 8 chapters...


1. **Chapter 1: Team Project Setup** - This chapter covers how to set up a Team Project, which is a logical container isolating all tools and artifacts associated with a software application together in a single namespace. Features such as Welcome pages, Dashboards, Team Rooms, and many more enable better collaboration within Teams, whereas the ability to rename Team Projects and scripting Team Project creation empowers you to better administer a Team Project. In this chapter, we'll learn the different features of a Team Project and how to set up these features to leverage them to their full potential.

2. **Chapter 2: Setting Up and Managing Code Repositories** - TFS is the only product to offer a centralized as well as distributed version control system. In this chapter, we'll learn how to set up both TFVC and Git repositories in a single project and how to tackle technical debt by enforcing code reviews and code analysis into the development workflows. 

3. **Chapter 3: Planning and Tracking Work** - Requirements that are implemented but never used, or those that are used just long enough to identify that they don't satisfy the needs of the users cause and waste, re-work, and dissatisfaction. In this chapter, we'll learn how to set up and customize multiple backlogs, Kanban, and Sprint Task Board. We'll also learn how to integrate with external planning tools using Service Hooks, and how to improve the feedback loop by leveraging the feedback features in TFS.

4. **Chapter 4: Building Your Application** - This chapter introduces the new build system (TFBuild), which is a cross platform, open, and extensible task-based execution system with a rich web interface that allows the authoring, queuing, and monitoring of builds. In this chapter, we'll learn how
to set up and use TFBuild for continuous integration. We'll also learn how to integrate TFBuild with SonarQube and GitHub. We'll also review features that help lay the foundations for continuous delivery of software.

5. **Chapter 5: Testing Your Application** - Low quality software just isn't acceptable. But you may ask "what is the right level of quality?" In this chapter, we'll learn how to plan, track, and automate using the testing tools available in TFS. We'll also learn how to leverage the new
build system to integrate non-Microsoft testing frameworks, such as Selenium and NUnit, into the automation testing workflows.

6. **Chapter 6: Releasing Your Application** - The new web-based Release Manager in TFS that uses the same agent and task infrastructure offered by TFBuild. In this chapter, we'll learn how to set up, secure, and deploy to multiple environments using release pipelines. We'll also learn how to track and  report on releases delivered through the release pipeline. The techniques in this chapter enable you to set up your software for continuous delivery.

7. **Chapter 7: Managing Team Foundation Server** - Teaches you how to update, maintain, and optimize your TFS, enabling high availability for geo-distributed Teams and reducing the administration overheads.

8. **Chapter 8: Extending and Customizing Team Foundation Server** - It is not uncommon for organizations to have different tools to manage different parts of the life cycle, for example, Jira for Agile project management, TeamCity for builds, Jenkins for release management, and ServiceNow for service management. In this chapter, we'll learn about the TFS object model and TFS REST APIs to programmatically access and integrate with systems. In this chapter, we'll also cover how to customize Team Projects by leveraging Process Template customization
