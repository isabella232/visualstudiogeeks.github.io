Ever wanted to see all the details of your build definition including its steps, triggers, history etc in a neat report so that you can print it or share it with a colleague? Well, now you can. Just export the build definition as PDF and get everything printed in a neat report. No need to click individual build steps to see build step arguments, also no need to browse individual tabs to see triggers, history etc.

## Get Started

> **Get it from Marketplace**: [http://bit.ly/exportaspdf](http://bit.ly/exportaspdf)

**Note:** The extension only supports new (non XAML) build defintions.

Once you install the extension, go to `Builds` hub and right click on any build definition. You will see a new menu item `Export as PDF`. Click on it and you will be able to select what to include in the report. Seclect the sections you want to be included in the PDF and click `Export as PDF`. The extension will scans your build definition, gets the details and generates the PDF which can be saved to your drive.

## What you can export?
You can export following properties of the build definition.

- Build steps
- Variables
- Triggers
- History

## Limitations/Known issues
Due to VSTS REST API still being in a `preview`, following build defintion properties cannot be exported as of now. They will be supported in future versions of the extension.
